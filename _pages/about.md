Hey guys, welcome to my home!

When I was very young, I expressed a strong interest in computers.  Cracking software and modifying games are my favorite stuff. I was good at physics but not mathematics when I was in middle school, thus I finally failed to enter the physics industry. By chance, I was admitted to the major of Educational Technology. During the four years of university, I studied various computer science and psychological related knowledge, and slowly discovered that computer science seems to be my true love. Then I tried hard to supplement my knowledge of mathematics, therefore I have successfully entered [Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) to study Artificial Intelligence. 

 Currently, I am a master student of the [School of Software of Dalian University of Technology](https://ssdut.dlut.edu.cn/en.htm). I am a self-motivated soul with science. My curriculum vitae is [here](https://xiangtai-chen.github.io/cv/). My research interests include graph learning and graph data mining. Friends are welcome to contact me via [email](mailto:chenxiangtai@outlook.com).
